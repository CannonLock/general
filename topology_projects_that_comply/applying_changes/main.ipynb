    "All Fields of Science are taken directly from the topology project YAML files. There is a mapping file but that is not applied in any way that would impact GRACC accounting. \n",

    "There exists a mapping file on Topology to map the NSF fields from these records to a NSF defined Field of Science. These NSF Fields of Science originate in this [pdf](../nsf_fos.pdf). The mapping file is not strict in its adherence to this PDF and has some additional fields and casing differences. \n",

    "Below are the steps to correct the Fields of Science for all projects in their project yaml files to those specified in the original NSF PDF as well as the newest version of the [NSF Field of Study](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf24300/assets/technical-notes/tables/nsf24300-taba-005.xlsx).\n"
